# Ixian Lite Wallet
Ixian Lite Wallet is a lightweight console executable which allows using an Ixian wallet without running a full Ixian-DLT Node.

## Running
Download the latest binary release or you can compile the code yourself.

### Windows
Double-click on the IxianLiteWallet.exe to start the wallet.

### Linux
Download and install the latest Mono release for your Linux distribution. 
The default Mono versions shipped with most common distributions are outdated.

Go to the [Mono official website](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-lin) and follow the steps for your Linux distribution.
We recommend you install the **mono-complete** package.

Open a terminal and navigate to the IxianLiteWallet folder, then type
```
mono IxianLiteWallet.exe
```
to start the wallet.

## Building
### Windows
Visual Studio 2017 is required (Community Edition is fine), you can get it from here: [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

Several NuGetPackages are downloaded automatically during the build process.

### Linux
Download and install the latest Mono release for your Linux distribution. The default Mono versions shipped with most common distributions are outdated.

Go to the [Mono official website](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-lin) and follow the steps for your Linux distribution.

We recommend you install the **mono-complete** package.

For Debian based distributions such as Ubuntu, type
```
sudo apt install mono-complete nuget msbuild git gcc
```
or if you have a Redhat based distribution, type
```
sudo yum install mono-complete nuget msbuild git gcc
```

Next you'll need to build the IxianLiteWallet solution. You can do this by typing the following commands in the terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/ProjectIxian/Ixian-Core.git
git clone https://github.com/ProjectIxian/Ixian-LiteWallet.git
cd Ixian-LiteWallet/IxianLiteWallet
nuget restore IxianLiteWallet.sln
msbuild IxianLiteWallet.sln /p:Configuration=Release
```
The IxianLiteWallet will be compiled and placed in the IxianLiteWallet/bin/Release/ folder.

## Development branches

There are two main development branches:
* **master**: This branch is used to build the binaries for the latest stable release of Ixian Lite Wallet. It should change slowly and be quite well-tested. This is also the default branch for anyone who wishes to build their Ixian software from source.
* **development**: This is the main development branch. The branch might not always be kept bug-free, if an extensive new feature is being worked on. If you are simply looking to build a current binary yourself, please use one of the release tags which will be associated with the master branch.

## Documentation

You can find more documentation on how to build, APIs and other documents on [Ixian Documentation Pages](https://docs.ixian.io).
